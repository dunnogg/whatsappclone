# React Project with Vite

This is a React project set up with Vite for fast and efficient development. Below are the instructions to get the project up and running locally.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management

You can check your installed versions by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunnogg/whatsappclone.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd whatsappclone
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the development server

To start the development server, run:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### 5. Open the project in your browser

Once the development server starts, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`. You should see your React application running.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Starts the development server and opens the app in the browser with hot-reloading enabled.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the project for production to the `dist` folder. This optimizes your app for the best performance.

### `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`

Preview the production build locally. This serves the optimized build as it will appear in production.

## Additional Information

- This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool for fast bundling and hot module replacement (HMR).
- The project is set up with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the default Vite React template.
